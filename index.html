    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Overview</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The overarching goal of our research in this phase is to:

     <b>Identify key elements that contribute to a welcoming and intuitive experience for potential mentor users.
     Uncover potential usability barriers encountered by new mentor users during the sign-up process.
     Explore the perspectives and preferences of mentors in the matching process. </b> </p>

      <h3 class="w3-bold"><i>Generative Research</i></h3>
        <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Identity Label Research</i></h4>
          <p class="w3-justify">Previous UX Research found that potential Thrive Out Loud (TOL) users want clear, inclusive wording when asked identity questions. This label identity research was conducted to offer guidance on how to phrase questions and provide a comprehensive set of answer options. This report synthesizes industry norms and provides the recommendations on asking gender, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity. <br> <br>

        <b>Method: </b>
          <uL>
            <li>UXR Lead initiate collaboration with UXW </li>
        <li>4 UXR apprentices and 3 UXW apprentices collected data from competitor platforms and authorities on their chosen identity category: gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity. Data was then analyzed via a SWOT analysis</li>
        <li>UXR team synthesized key takeaways and recommendations</li>
        </ul> 
        <br>

        SWOT analysis and collaborative work found <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/WY2evDkH4qop5VFPHtEdC7/Phase-4%3A-Sean's-Legacy-UX-Research?type=whiteboard&node-id=397-2208&t=Wycyz8DwcJ6m8XCd-4">here:</a> <br> <br>

        <b>Key Findings: </b>
        <ul>
        <li>Allow TOL users to select multiple response options, ideally without a limit</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing an LGBTQIA+ audience with an elaborate list of identity labels “allows sexual minorities to choose the identity label that best matches their identity” vs not selecting at all ([Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/methodology/259457/measure-lgbt-population.aspx))</li>
          </ul>
        <li>The options of “no label” (gender/sexual orientation), “not sure,” and “not listed (free text)”* have been commonly used across different platforms". These options are fundamentally different from one another and all need to be included </li>
          <ul>
            <li>“There is no one way to be LGBTQ, nor is there one way to describe LGBTQ people” ([Glaad](https://glaad.org/reference/)). “Not listed (free text)” write in option gives TOL users the ability to further self identify</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Support TOL users in their evolving identity: clearly communicate the ability to edit selections</li>
        <li>Consider wording the questions in parallel way for all three identity categories (gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and race) to reduce cognitive load
        <li>Consider allowing mentees to efficiently answer profile creation questions alongside their equivalent matching QRE questions</li>
        <li>If users are able to skip a question, remind them to go back to it at a later time</li>
        <li>Identity questions have the potential to serve as a valuable hub for resources and information such as: definitions, links to sources, FAQ page, guidance and support for users</li>
        </ul>

       <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Heuristic Evaluation</i></h4>
          <p>To gain a general understanding of the status of the current designs, the team evaluated screens the UXD team provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8aPFF08MIEdi4hkYYAtlww/SL-UX-Design-Figma-(Phase-4)?type=design&node-id=200-37255&mode=design&t=BiK8JF42m7bOfgOD-0) against Nielsen Norman Group’s heuristic guidelines.
            <ul>
              <li>We evaluated sets of screens or features by level of severity (0 - no impact to 4 - catastrophic) </li>
              <li>Then the team voted on items to flag for UXD team and sent recommendations</li>

            </ul>
          Findings:
            <ul>
             <li>The most frequently violated heuristic was Consistency and Standards (40% of the 62 issues found)</li>
              <li>Violations tended to be minor (level 2 at 35%) or major (level 3 at 35%) usability issues; rarely catastrophic (level 4 at 5%)</li>
              <li>Screens with the most violations were profile creation and editing, onboarding, and reporting</li>
              <li>Of the 62 items flagged, 16 (26%) were voted most important for UXD team to address </li>

  <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Matching Preference Survey</i></h4>
      <p class="w3-justify">An unmoderated survey was sent out to collect information about personal thoughts on mentor preferences for matching with potential mentees. The purpose of the survey was to seek quantitative validation of findings from the matching preference exercise in our qualitative research. <br>

        Using the same inclusion criteria as our user interviews/usability testing, the survey collected over 20 qualified responses. <br>
        More than 80% of respondents had 5+ years of work experience and almost half were previously mentors. <br>
        All respondents consented to be contacted to participate in future research. <br> <br>

        Unmoderated survey participants received the following prompt and instructions:  “As a mentor, what factors are most important for you to match with a mentee?  Rank the labels (from 1-7) to show the most to least important factors for mentoring compatibility.” <br> <br>

        The labels shown in randomized order were: 
        <ul>
          <li>Mentee’s age </li>
          <li>Language </li>
          <li>Professional industry </li>
          <li>Focus area mentorship (work, study, career change, etc.) </li>
          <li>Race and ethnicity </li>
          <li>Sexual orientation </li>
          <li>Gender </li>
        </ul>

        <b> Findings </b><br>
        
        In the moderated usability testing activity, <b>Professional Industry</b> and <b>Focus Area</b> were tied for the most important criteria in the matching process. <br>
        In the unmoderated survey, <b>Professional Industry</b> and <b>Focus Area</b> were ranked as the top 1 and 2 most important criteria, respectively. <br> <br>

        Unmoderated survey participants also received the prompt: “Please explain why your highest ranked factor is considered "most important" for mentoring compatibility.”  The summarized responses are below with a number indicating how many participants ranked that criteria as their #1 ranked factor.  
        <ul>
          <li>Professional Industry (9): Mentoring relationships become useful when the mentor and mentee have similar fields. Mentors can have years of experience that they can share to their mentees and provide valuable advice to help them accomplish their goals. </li>
          <li>Language (7): Mentors and mentees need to be able to communicate clearly. Mentors can guide their mentees if they’re able to communicate in the language they’re most comfortable with. </li>
          <li>Focus Area (5): It’s important that mentors and mentees are aligned on goals. Mentors want to offer guidance by serving as a resource for specific focus areas.  Mentees want mentorship from people who are experts in their field of interest and share career experiences. </li>
          <li>Race and Ethnicity (1): A potential mentor is concerned that if a mentee has a different race and ethnicity to them, they may not be able to relate to the mentee in that area, possibly forming a bridge in the relationship. </li>
        </ul>
        Lastly, participants were asked: “Other than the options already listed, what other factors, if any, do you think are important to consider for mentoring compatibility? 
        <ul>
          <li>Personality Traits (4) </li>
          <li>Goals for the Mentorship Relationship (3) </li>
          <li>Interests (2) </li>
          <li>Location (2) </li>
          <li>Availability (1) </li>
          <li>Feedback Style (1) </li>
          <li>Disabilities (1) </li>
          <li>Educational Background (1) </li>
          <li>Social-Economic Status (1) </li>
          <li>Upbringing or Cultural Background (1) </li>
          <li>Identifying Hard Nos & Wishlist Items (1) </li>
        </ul>

    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Next Steps</i></h4>
      <p class="w3-justify">

        <ol>
        <li>Identity Label Research - Implement in UXD and UXW designs.
        <li> Heuristic Evaluation - Pass to UXD and UXW for implementation.
        <li>User Personas - Revise to reflect findings.
          <ul>
            <li>The mentor persona received the most revision because this phase research focused on the mentor experience.
            <li>The mentee persona includes recommendations for future phases, including potentially breaking this persona into two personas, and beginning desk research into mental health benefits of mentoring.
            <li>Note that the UXW team found user personas valuable for updating the content tone. Communicate with UXW to determine any additional needs from the personas, and continue to update them.
            </ul>
        <li>User Interviews and Usability Tests - See recommendations [above](https://www.notion.so/UX-Research-fbd938ffa1af4505b8249e99f3d287be?pvs=21).
          <ul>
            <li>One area we were not able to address in this phase of usability testing is the product goal of an onboarding process that takes no longer than 3 minutes. Unmoderated, timed testing of the onboarding flow should be a research priority after recommendations have been implemented by XFN teams. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Matching Preferences Survey - See key findings [above](https://www.notion.so/UX-Research-fbd938ffa1af4505b8249e99f3d287be?pvs=21).
          <ul>
            <li>The survey findings matched the UI/UT findings in that participants see industry and mentoring focus area as the most important elements for matching. Other elements, like mentee age and race and ethnicity, changed ranking, suggesting more research may be needed about how users prioritize those factors.
              <ul>
                <li>In tandem with this, work with Dev to determine what information is needed to inform the matching algorithm </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Consider groups needing further research:
              <ul>
                <li>Extending data collection to mentor demographics not covered in existing sample population </li>
                <li>Shift the survey to focus on mentee matching preferences </li>
              </ul>

      <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Interview Insight </i></h4>
        <p class="w3-justify"> “It always looks like the people taking group classes are having so much fun but I am pretty. .. intimidated I guess. A lot of them seem to go each week and I don’t know what the class is going to be like.” - Megan, a year long Synergy Health club member <br>

          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Most everyone who was interviewed had an interest in participating in group classes but had a variety of reasons that stop them from attending more or attending any at all. </li>
            <li>The most common reasons including: being nervous/embarrassed to be in a new class, not knowing what a class will entail, forgetting to reserve a spot in the class and not attending because if it. </li>
            <li>Most everyone interview had previously downloaded and opened the app but only about half of the interviews members actually used it. When asked why some members had never used it, the reasons given were: it seemed like a long set up, didn’t see the use of using it, didn’t know how to use it. </li>
            <li>Biggest reaccuring theme was members being interested in the classes but not know where to start or what classes to take. </li>

            <li>For example: one participant who was an avid runner had found herself benched from running because of a hip injury. She was interested in finding alternative ways to exercise however she wanted to make sure she wasn’t going to take a class that was going to further hurt her hip. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Survey Insights </i></h4>
       <p class="w3-justify text-align left"> 
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>About 50 percent of members surveyed have previously used the app.
            <li>About 80 percent use the app to reserve spots in classes while 10 percent only use the app to look at the class schedule. 
            <li>A smaller percentage of members use the app to find contact information, and the smallest percentage of members use the app to keep track of their workouts.
            <li>The majority of app users expressed that they have become frustrated while using the app. 
         </ul>

        <p class="w3-justify"> This map demonstrates the perspective of a Synergy App user based on the initial surveys and interviews that were done. It shows what a typical member does, feels, thinks, hears, and sees. It also highlights some pain points a member runs into and also value they gain from using the app and the gym. <br>

      <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>User Flow </i></h4>
        <p class="w3-justify"> Because several members spoke about the effort to start an account to start using the app seemed like too much work, I thought it would be smart to create a user flow of this task. <br> <br>

      <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Landing Page feedback</i></h4>
        <p class="w3-justify"> I developed a landing page showcasing the key features of the Synergy gym health app. Following that, I conducted various tests on both the landing page and the concepts presented within it. I gathered qualitative feedback and conducted both a first-click test and a 10-second test. <br> <br>

              <li>It looked like there was a lot of information about the gym on the app. 
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>I could look at the app to see if it included information that would answer my question. If not I could contact the gym. 
              <li>I could get in touch with a gym trainer through the app.
            </ul>>

              <li>Yes, if questions come up for me it would be nice to be able to find the answers without the effort of a phone call or going to the gym. 
              <li>Not sure. I already know what I want to do at the gym.

      <h4 class="w3-opacity"><i>Final Thoughts</i></h4>
        <p class="w3-justify"> 
        Summary: <br>
        While members seem interested in both the app and group classes, their curiosity is stifled by the high amount of effort it takes to use the app. Members do not have a good understanding of what value the app can add to their gym experience. 
        Members’ interest and motivation to attend group classes is diminished by uncertainty of what the classes entail. Members will hesitate to participate when they have many questions about what they are walking into. <br> <br>
        Suggestions: 
        <ul>
        <li>Clear, easy and fast way to set up an account on the Active Wellness Center app </li>
        <li>Descriptive class and teacher summaries within the app </li>
        <li>Member reviews for each group class within the app</li>
        <li>Ability to talk to and get advice from personal trainers through the app </li>
        </ul></p>
